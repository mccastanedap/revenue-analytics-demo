# Revenue Analytics Demo â€” SaaS KPIs & Forecasting

This project simulates a SaaS environment and demonstrates how to compute **RevOps KPIs** (MRR, ARR, Churn Rate, NRR) using Python, SQL (dbt-style), and Power BI.  
Itâ€™s designed as a learning portfolio aligned with roles like **Senior Data Analyst at Twilio**.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. Clone or download the repo.  
2. Open `notebooks/01_revenue_kpis.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.  
3. Run all cells to generate:
   - KPI tables â†’ `outputs/*.csv`
   - Charts â†’ `outputs/*.png`

## ðŸ“Š KPIs Implemented
- **MRR:** Monthly Recurring Revenue  
- **ARR:** Annual Recurring Revenue (`MRR * 12`)  
- **Churn Rate:** MRR lost to churn Ã· prior-month MRR  
- **NRR:** Current MRR of existing customers Ã· previous MRR  

## ðŸ’¡ Insights Example
- Enterprise customers drive the highest ARR with the lowest churn.
- NRR averages **>105 %**, showing strong expansion revenue.
- SMB segment shows most churn volatility â€” an opportunity for retention programs.

## ðŸ§  Next Steps
- Add forecasting notebook (Prophet / ARIMA).  
- Build a Power BI dashboard and embed screenshots.  
- Extend with CAC / LTV and pipeline conversion analysis.
